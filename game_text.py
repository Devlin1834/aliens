The Lounge is the area where your crew goes to relax on their breaks,
close enough to the Mess for easy relaxation, and close enough
to the Bridge to come back quickly in case of emergency.

There are many sofas and armchairs spread over the room, including the one you were just sleeping in.
The room is messy with many books, magazines, empty plates and glasses strewn about. The
Birthday Wall is next to the door behind you.

Out that door is the Central Corridor and a door to the Mess hall is on your left.
The wall in front of you is adorned with monitors for entertainment and the wall to the right
is a window that shut its blast door when the power cut off.

The power is out so the Ships onboard Computer is not responsive
The automated doors are not working either, meaning they will need to be
pryed open. The life support is hooked up to auxillery power and seems to be working.
With no power there is no way to call for help or contact your crew without screaming.

You notice a small lamp that can easily be used as a club and a book titled
'The History of the UEA'. This forces you wonder who on your crew is a closet dork
                        """

You approach the door and listen for a while
A rush of fear runs through you when you hear a faint clicking
You wonder what kind of horrible alien has attacked your ship and can't
help but feel that this situation is a little bit derivative. 
Without visual confirmation you cannot be sure what you're hearing,
but you don't like it, whatever it it.

lounge_calendar = """
The birthday wall is your crews way of staying close to home while away for a 
year and a half. You can see your sons birthday, April 11, the Navigators
Wife's birthday, October 27, the Secrity Officer's Daughter's birthday is 
July 1{}, and the Doctor's birthday is December 2. He always was clueless.

Looking around the mess hall you notice the dirty dishes and 
cant help but think you hired a bunch of slobs. There is bread
and open bags of chips left on the counter, probably stale at this
point. They go stale much faster in the highly oxygenated environment
of the ship. 

On the countertop you notice a copy of the ships manual, opened to the 
first chapter. You also notice a kitchen knife sitting in the sink.

There are three doors in the Mess Hall: one to the Central Corridor that runs
horrizonatlly accross the ship, one to the Main Body where the crew meets for meals 
and meetings, and one that leads to the Crew Lounge where the crew relaxes in 
their free time.

You hear a faint clicking sound and the scurrying of multiple legs on the ground. Occasionally
the clicking is punctuated by the sound of a clanging or a trilling. The invaders sound like

bridge_la = """
The bridge is a small room, mostly full of chairs and screens. The Walls and floors are all
an uninteresting grey (so as to avoid distraction) and the front wall is a large window out the front
of the ship. 

In the center of the room sits the primary console, the seats of the Navigator, Gunnery Officer,
and Helmsman. The communication console is on the edge of the room, next to the ships diagnostics.
The ships secuirty center is opposite the communication center, its many monitors  taking up most of the wall.
In the center of the room sat the captains chair and console.

Out the window at the helm, you could see into the infinite abyss of space.

You observe the navigators station, a system of computers designed to plot courses through warp-space.
Warp-space is incredibly dangerous to travel through, but necessary in order to reach distant planets in
a decent amount of time. Looking at the course plotted, you notice an anomaly. The Navigator had you taking
an unusualy indirect route to Thiressa IX. Navigators are supposed to take as direct a route as 
possible, to save fuel. This route is just wasteful. You make a copy of the course and pocket it, 
you'll fix this when you get your ship in order.

bridge_gunnery = """
Gunnery officer is a bit of a misnomer. While piracy is a threat, the primary
responsibility of the gunnery office is maintenance of the tow cable and 
hydralics associated with cargo. The ship does have some guns, but nothing
substantial, certainly not enough to justify paying a full time crew member.
Upon examining the Gunnery Officers console it becomes apparent what one Beetle 
was up to. The console is broken, rendering the ship unable to operate its 
minimal weaponry, and all the external cargo pods have been released        .

You can guess that the Beetles have sabotaged the engines in order to cut the power, and entered the ship through
the breach in the docking bay.

his hands and the Doctor is in the Gunnery Officers room, setting what looks to be a broken arm.

You see before you the leader of the war party, a truly terrifying sight.
He stands roughly 7 foot tall on powerful legs that end in three pronged feet. 
His entie frame is covered in thick exo-skeleton, the usual bugs are brown with
green stripes, but he is a bright vibrant yellow with purple stripes. It is as 
though nature is saying that normal bugs need to blend in to survive, but this
*thing* can dare the universe to attack it, and WIN. His four arms are long and
end in four fingered hands, if daggers could be fingers. His face is
squat, with foot-long mandibles extending down from the sides of his mouth. You
can imagine them crushing his opponent, a slow, agonizing death worthy only for
those he hates. But his most haunting aspect is his eyes, his eyes seem almost 
human. You can see his soul through them, an inteligence and emotion that tells
you this is not a monster, not a *thing*, but a person. And he has decided to kill
you.

medbay_la = """
The medbay is the ships operating room, emergency room, and doctors office all rolled into one.
In the back corner is the Doctors desk, covered in medical papers, anatomical busts, and equiment.
In the center of the room is a large steel table upon which he performs both surgeries and 
check ups. In the corner opposite his desk are a pair of loveseats and a small coffe table, for anyone
who needs to wait. 

You look around the medbay and see the Medijector sitting on the desk. This could heal you, should
you need it. Hopefully you won't, but you should wait until absolutely necessary as it's a one off
without the Doctor around to operate it. 

There is a copy of the ships manual open on the coffee table in the waiting area. The Doctor appears
to be using it as reading material for his patients. As if having to wait wasn't bad enough.

On the desk is small glass box with the Doctor's operating equipment, including a small scalpel. It's
small but may be useful for fighting off those ugly things. Scalpels these days cut at the atomic level
and could slice right through that armor.

In the corner is a door to the Science Labs. On the wall across from it is a door to the central 
corridor.

scilab_la = """
Many people question why a freighter would have a Science Lab. But people also tend to overestimate 
just how much we know about outer space. In reality, we know nothing, and a well equipped science lab
keeps a ship prepared to deal with the unexpected and the never before encountered. There is a lot of
demand for research into the strangeness of the galaxy, many ships bring hire Science Officers in 
exchange for a cut of their grant money or publication royalties from any papers they write while on
board. This is the case of 'The Resilience'. 

Besides, calling it a science lab is a bit of a strech. You rented out an unused cargo hold
to a spectographer who studdies light and stars. His equipment has been set up in a rather
spartan manner with a couple big computers and pieces of equipment spread out around the room
and thick power cords runnng to across the floor.

There are a great many printed reports laying about his desk and a compicated looking scientific
instrument that you'd rather not touch. On a desk to your right, you see a copy of the Ships Manual.
On the desk at the far left wall, you see a report entitled 'The History of Colonization'. On the
main desk you see a report that seems to be recent. On the wall is an interesting looking star chart.

The Science Labs have access to the Med Bay.

mutiny (both of which happen more often than the UEA likes to admit). 

You can see the Armory door, locked and bolted. It is protected by the only thing in the room that 
is powered by the backup generator: an old keypad. No Biometric scanners on this ship, keypads are 
easier to maintain and fix.

Looking around the rest of the office, you can see his main console, powered down of course, but next
to it is his personal map of the ship, and on his desk is a security dossier: a folder containing
his research and assesment of his duties on our mission.

You approach heavily secured door and eye the keypad. You know that this system will lock you out

                      The UEA (United Earth Alliance) was formed in 2187 after first contact by the Galminorans.
                      The five member nations, The United States, China, India, Japan, and Germany, were all determined
                      to spearhead the first manned mission into Galminoran space in order to initiate trade proceedings.
                      For each country, allowing another country to beat them to Galminoran space posed a serious security
                      threat, so they formed an economic alliance, devoted to creating a spacecraft capable of deep space
                      travel, jointly manning that craft, and begining trade negotiations as a single entity. As the founding
                      nations reaped the benefits of Inter-Galactic trade, the UEA transitioned from a trade partnership
                      into a shared government, and was soon adopted by all 155 earth nations.

The communications log is open to a file descibing the structure of the UEA:

                      batallions from the militaries of its member nations. These donated batallions spend 3-5
                      years fighting for the UEA, then return to their home countries and pursue the ambitions
                      of their local governments and cultures.
                      
                      On the civilian side, The UEA directly governs only its colonies. Governing at home is left
                      to national governments. People are incentivized into settling on new colonies with generous
                      subsidies and homesteads. The colonies had the advantage of being closer to Galactic Society
                      than Earth, meaning better trade, but being so far from home bore its own challenges.
                      They cannot grow enough food to sustain themselves and cannot manufacture enough to 
                      support their lifestyles. Colonies rely upon UEA supply drops to maintain their people

                      logistics, it did not prove appealing to potential settlers. Life on the frontier 
                      was difficult, and not many people desired to leave the comforts of earth. The 
                      UEA desired more colonies, however, partly in order to reduce overcrowding and
                      resource strain on Earth, but also in order to increase UEA revenues. Colonies
                      are the only territories subject to direct UEA governance and taxation. The UEA
                      offers a variety of so called colonization incentives, and has made a grand 
                      showing of shipping off colonists on big ships with great fanfare, and yet, as 
                      of 2302, no colony has grown beyond 70,000 people. 
                          The greatest hurdle for the UEA to overcome is the mystery of colonial worlds.
                      due to limits in technology, we cannot directly communicate with colony worlds, 
                      leaving life on the frontier a great unknown for many of us. With recreational
                      space travel still out of reach for most people, the very few who know what
                      colonial worlds actually look like are those employed by the UEA to visit 
                      for supply runs, tax collecion, or transporting new colonists en masse, and
                      they are often tight lipped about what they saw. Rumors of highly competitive
                      hiring procedured by the UEA could shed light on why employees don't seem
                      talkative on the subject.

                      Fortunately for all, the UEA has never been in a military conflict with an
                      alien race. The UEA does not have a large navy, mostly because the few resources
                      remaining on earth are better spent developing a civillian fleet, not
                      war vessels that will likey never be used. The UEA does field a large number of
                      marines on every transport, as civilian protection, and does equip almost all ships
                      with weaponry to serve as protection while abroad. 
                          The few warships the UEA does posses are deadly and dangerous machines. The 
                      largest and newest is 'The Jupiter', a massive warship capable of erasing
                      cities at a time, and ripping apart smaller ships with a single shot from one
                      of its two massive railguns. Each of its two signature cannons fires shells the
                      size of tanks, but have never been used in combat. The Jupiter also possess the
                      ability to feild several squadrons of fighter craft, though such fighter craft
                      have yet to be manufactured, and make hyperspace jumps unaided by relays. 
                          'Such warships are important deterents' say UEA leaders 'not every intergalactic
                      society is as dedicated to peace as the Galminorans'. Despite this, no UEA warship
                      has seen combat, and few marines have ever had a reason to discharge their 
                      rifles.

                      MISSION ANALYSIS: SUPPLY RUN TO THIRESSA IX
                      SECURITY OFFICER ALEX O'HANNON
                      
                      My research for this trip has uncovered
                      something...strange. I have found numerous
                      records of flights to Thiressa IX, but these
                      records...many of them are impossible.
                      Almost no passenger records exist, the few 
                      records that do are the same passengers 
                      over and over again...
                      And to make matters stranger, all records
                      stop abrubtly, eight years ago, despite
                      the colony being supposedly thirteen years
                      old? I went to the regional office to get
                      the colonial maintenance records and the 
                      woman at the desk disapeared into the back
                      for almost an hour before another man 
                      brought me a file that just didn't feel
                      right. The Taxes collected were too high
                      for the passenger records I had, and the 
                      backers all had familiar sounding names.
                      So I pulled out the files I had for my
                      mothers colony, Shirella IV, and the 
                      files MATCHED EXACTLY. Someone went 
                      through the trouble of copying it with
                      a fake name just to throw me off and I
                      want to know WHY. I can't tell anyone
                      about this yet, not until I know more.
                      But I am very much looking forward to

You look closely at the science officers map. He has drawn on the zones of 
control of alien races. The Galminorans control the largest area, of course.
The Zhendojan Beetles control an area between them and Klimmt Space, 
Klimmt space in turn neighbors many UEA Colonies. Thiressa IX is farther away
from most colonies and much closer to Klimmt Space than you expected.
If the point is to trade with Galminorans, why colonize over here?

                      The summit is the Galminorans attempt to foster a peaceful solution to the war
                      and aggression between the Zhendojans and the Klimmt, who have been warring over
                      a border dispute for the past eight years. The war, which came on suddenly, but
                      not surprisingly between the two warlike cultures, has resisted all attempts for
                      a brokerage of peace. This has not stopped Galminorans from trying; the peace-
                      loving aliens have hosted this confference every year proposing grander peace
                      incentives, but both parties consistently turn them down. This year was no

                      been essentially ceased between the galaxy's largest economy and the two
                      warrior cultures. The Galminorans have even gone as far as to threaten 
                      trade sanctions on any government supporting the war effort, causing a
                      sharp decrease in openly pledged support and curbing the growing military
